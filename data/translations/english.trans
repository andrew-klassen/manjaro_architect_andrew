_SecCoreTitle="Disable Coredump Logging"
_SecKernTitle="Restrict Access to Kernel Logs"
_SecKernBody="Kernel logs may contain information an attacker can use to identify and exploit kernel vulnerabilities, including sensitive memory addresses.\n\nIf systemd-journald logging has not been disabled, it is possible to create a rule in /etc/sysctl.d/ to disable access to these logs unless using root privilages (e.g. via sudo)."

_SecJournBody="systemd-journald collects and stores kernel logs, system logs, audit records, and standard outputs and error messages from services.\n\nBy default, a persistent (non-volatile) journal size limit is 10% of the root partition size: a 500G root means a 50G limit to data stored in /var/log/journal. 50M should be sufficent. Logging can also be disabled, although solving system problems may be more difficult."
_SecCoreBody="A core dump is a record of computer memory when a process crashes.\n\nUseful for developers but not the average user, core dumps waste system resources and can also contain sensitive data such as passwords and encryption keys.\n\nThe default systemd behavior is to generate core dumps for all processes in /var/lib/systemd/coredump. This behavior can be overridden by creating a configuration file in the /etc/systemd/coredump.conf.d/ directory."
